# Scientific Calculator 2.0 üßÆ

## Introduction

Welcome to Scientific Calculator 2.0! This project is a sophisticated tool designed to offer a modern, reliable, and versatile solution for scientific calculations. Developed as a *personal project* to sharpen my JavaScript skills, it was built entirely from **scratch without relying on tutorials**. Notably, the calculator avoids using the **```eval```** function, despite its convenience, to **prioritize security and performance**. Given the short development timeline, the calculator may not be complete or free from errors, but it provides a robust foundation for scientific computation.

**Difficulty: 5/10**

## Features

### Modern Interface üé®
- **Sleek Design**: The calculator boasts a clean and modern interface with vibrant, saturated colors to enhance usability and aesthetics.

### Comprehensive Scientific Operations üìê
- **Wide Range of Functions**: Covers most scientific operations, including trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions, among others.

### Secure and Efficient üö´
- **No `eval` Used**: For better security, the calculator does not utilize the `eval` function. All operations are manually implemented from the ground up, ensuring a safer and more controlled environment.

### Post-Fix Notation üìä
- **Advanced Calculation Method**: Implements the PostFix notation (Reverse Polish Notation) as discussed in "Data Structures & Algorithm Analysis in C++" by Mark Weiss, ensuring accurate handling of operator precedence.

### Responsive Design üì±
- **Adaptability**: The design is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### Input Flexibility üñ±Ô∏è‚å®Ô∏è
- **Mouse and Keyboard Support**: Fully supports both mouse and keyboard inputs, making it easy to use in different scenarios.

### Interactive Behaviors and Sound Effects üîä
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Includes interactive behaviors and sound effects to make the calculation process more engaging and intuitive.

## Technologies Used üë®‚Äçüíª

- **HTML**: Forms the structure of the calculator's interface.
- **CSS**: Used to style the interface with modern and vibrant aesthetics.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the calculator's functionality, implementing custom algorithms and handling user interactions.

## Project Structure ‚öôÔ∏è

The project is organized to separate concerns clearly, with distinct directories for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. This structure facilitates easy maintenance and expansion.
